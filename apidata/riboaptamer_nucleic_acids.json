    "description": "The trans-activating responsive (TAR) RNA element located in the 5'-untranslated region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome is a 59 nt imperfect stem-loop essential for the viral replication. TAR regulates transcription by interacting with both viral and cellular proteins.",

    "description": "Transfer RNA (tRNA), often referred to simply as tRNA, is a 76-90 nucleotide RNA whose 3' end can be catalyzed by aminoacyl-TRNA synthetase to attach a specific amino acid. In the process of translation, tRNA can recognize the codon on mRNA by its own anti-codon, and transport the amino acid corresponding to the codon to the polypeptide chain in ribosome synthesis.",
