Since it is a small, easily available, and highly stable protein, it has been subject to extensive research regarding its function and structure. Lysozyme acts as a non-specific defense against bacteria and fungi. It is a component of the innate immune system, and is an important part of an infant's diet to ward off diarrhea. It is an enzyme known for its ability to degrade the polysaccharide architecture of many kinds of cell walls, normally for the purpose of protection against bacterial infection.",
